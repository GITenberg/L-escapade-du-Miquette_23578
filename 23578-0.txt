L'escapade de Miquette.

[Illustration: Camo.

L'escapade de Miquette.]

Miquette est une jolie petite fille de cinq ans, rose, vive et gaie;
mais il surgit parfois sous sa toison dorée des idées tout à fait
singulières; ainsi, ce matin, elle refuse catégoriquement de manger sa
soupe.

[Illustration]

Miquette jette à terre, avec une moue dégoûtée, le chocolat qui lui est
offert pour remplacer la soupe. La poupée Zizi est indignée. Quelle
petite capricieuse!

[Illustration]

De grosses larmes roulent sur les joues de Miquette: ne veut-on pas
maintenant l'obliger à manger ce vilain œuf?

--Qu'on le donne à Zizi!

[Illustration]

Non! décidément cela ne peut pas durer ainsi, Miquette est trop
malheureuse! Elle jette sa serviette, renverse son tabouret et
s'enfuit...

[Illustration]

Miquette franchit la porte du jardin en courant. Enfin! elle va être
libre comme les petits paysans qui jouent toute la journée dans les
champs.

[Illustration]

Quelles délices! Le ciel est bleu, les oiseaux chantent, les prés sont
remplis de jolies fleurettes. Miquette ne se lasse pas de faire des
bouquets.

[Illustration]

Frou... frou... frou... Qu'est-ce qui bouge ainsi? Miquette se retourne
vivement, un peu effrayée. Un petit nez qui remue drôlement, deux
longues oreilles.

--Bonjour, Jeannot Lapin!

[Illustration]

Miquette se roule avec des cris de joie dans l'herbe parfumée; étendue
sur ce moelleux tapis, elle contemple les nuages qui courent vite,
vite...

[Illustration]

Quel gentil carillon! Miquette écoute, elle compte, c'est midi, c'est
l'angélus... Au détour d'un sentier, elle aperçoit un clocher et
s'élance dans la direction du village.

[Illustration]

Miquette s'arrête, intéressée; toute une nichée de petits poussins
picorent avec ardeur sous la surveillance de maman poule qui leur
désigne du bec le grain qu'ils doivent prendre. Ils sont très
obéissants, les poussins.

[Illustration]

Voici maintenant des moutons; ils broutent sagement l'herbe épaisse du
pré; Miquette, pour mieux les considérer, s'étend à plat ventre près
d'eux.

--Ça doit être délicieux, des fleurs; mange, petit mouton!

[Illustration]

Des grognements féroces attirent Miquette dans la cour d'une ferme. Deux
grosses bêtes, les pieds dans leur auge, dévorent gloutonnement leur
pâtée. Dieu! qu'ils sont laids; Miquette se détourne, écœurée.

[Illustration]

Le grand air, ça creuse, et Miquette se sent tout à coup un grand
appétit; elle envie le petit bonhomme qui mord à pleine bouche dans sa
tartine. Et Miquette grogne:

--J'ai faim, moi, na!

[Illustration]

Miquette arrête un petit paysan chargé d'une terrine pleine d'un liquide
blanc qui lui semble délicieux:

--Donne-moi un peu de ton lait, dis, j'ai très faim.

[Illustration]

--C'est point du lait, mam'zelle, c'est du caillé!

--Pouah! du caillé, c'est mauvais! Tu as donc déjà mangé la crème?

--Oh! non, mam'zelle, la crème on l'a vendue au château...

[Illustration]

Une toute petite, émue de l'air désolé de Miquette, la tire par sa robe:

--Pleure pas, voilà un gros morceau de couenne de lard, c'est ça qui est
bon!

Miquette refuse.

[Illustration]

--Et toi, qu'est-ce que tu manges?

--Du pain frotté d'ail, mam'zelle.

Quelle horreur! Miquette reste rêveuse; décidément, les petits paysans
ne se régalent pas de bonnes choses.

[Illustration]

Une fillette toute ronde passe avec un gros pain sous son bras, Miquette
court après:

--Donne, donne-moi vite du bon pain de seigle; je l'aime beaucoup.

[Illustration]

Mais, après l'avoir goûté, Miquette le jette loin d'elle, en faisant la
grimace. Ça ne vaut pas la brioche qu'elle dédaignait hier encore. Elle
se trouve tout à coup bien ingrate.

[Illustration]

Vite, allons retrouver maman. Miquette court à perdre haleine et ne
s'arrête que devant la barrière du jardin. Oh! joie, voilà la maison et
la petite Blanchette qui se promène tranquillement dans l'herbe.

[Illustration]

Miquette ne veut plus être capricieuse, comprenant enfin combien elle
était choyée, et c'est d'un petit air bien humble qu'elle vient à la
cuisine réclamer son déjeuner.

[Illustration]

--Ma soupe, ma bonne petite soupe, ne cesse de dire Miquette; puis elle
en réclame une seconde fois; jamais elle ne l'a trouvée aussi exquise.

[Illustration]

Après la soupe, Miquette accueille avec transport l'œuf dont elle se
barbouille jusqu'aux yeux. Turc se demande avec inquiétude s'il en
restera pour lui et Zizi enthousiasmée bat des mains et crie bravo!

[Illustration]

Miquette a un bon petit cœur; elle veut partager son régal; vite elle
court à sa chambre et revient les bras chargés de ses enfants.

--Venez, mes chéris!

[Illustration]

Les chéris bien installés en rond, Miquette procède à la distribution
avec beaucoup de justice. Chacun son tour.

[Illustration]

La tasse est vide. Miquette est radieuse, ses enfants ont certainement
fait un délicieux repas. D'un ton grave, elle déclare:

--Et puis, vous savez, pour grandir, il faut toujours bien manger sa
soupe.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
